# Overview

(First! o.O) Personal website I coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js/JSX. <br>
I also used React Bootstrap for some components and 98.css. <br>
I have my projects, skills and socials here. (:

Permanently in construction because I'm never happy enough with the final result. :')



## Coming soon:
- contact forms;
- footer;
- minor ~~~~aesthetic~~~~ details;
- fully responsive design (it's 2/3 responsive as of now ðŸ˜­);
- ~~hosting!!!~~ it's official, you can finally see the website [here](https://adrianabot.github.io/). Deployed with GitHub Pages.


<sup><sub>Thanks to all the lovely people that helped me, especially mister @zer0-5 for aiding me with the deployment <3</sub></sup>
