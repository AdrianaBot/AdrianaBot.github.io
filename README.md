# Overview

Personal website I coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js/JSX. <br>
I also used React Bootstrap for some components and 98.css.

Permanently in construction because I'm never happy enough with the final result. :')



## Coming soon:
- contact forms;
- footer;
- minor ~~~~aesthetic~~~~ details;
- fully responsive design (it's 2/3 responsive as of now ðŸ˜­).
